<!-- toolkit-owned; edits are drift — see AGENTS.md -->

# Playbook: `update-governance`

1. Read the target repo's guidance, including any owner-only refresh rule.
   Locate the toolkit clone from `.agents/machines.md`, then sibling
   directories containing `tools/shipped-set.json`. If absent, clone
   `https://github.com/roethlar/Bixi.git` as a sibling and record the path
   under the current machine. Do not assume a home-directory layout.
2. Follow the git playbook's branch setup for installation changes. Run
   `py -3 <toolkit>/tools/refresh.py` on Windows, or a probed Python 3.10+
   interpreter on macOS/Linux, from the target repo root. Refresh syncs
   its source, reconciles the shipped set and commits its changes.
3. Report the summary and every DRIFT, FLAG or remediation offer.
   DRIFT means restored content, not a request to edit an installed copy.
   A foreign AGENTS.md needs an explicit replacement decision:
   owner-requested replacement uses `--force`; otherwise follow
   `<toolkit>/procedures/bootstrap.md`. Do not resolve flags on inference.
4. Verify the result and follow the git playbook through integration and
   local/remote work-branch deletion. Report pending steps honestly.

This operator adds no write authority beyond its defined refresh steps.
Repo-guidance edits and migration judgments require their own approved
scope. Refresh-installed governance remains toolkit-owned; installed
copies in the development toolkit are refreshed only by its owner.
